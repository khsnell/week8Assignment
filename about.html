        On October 2, 1950, Charles M. Schulz introduced a brand-new comic strip with an unlikely 
        round-headed hero, “Good ol’ Charlie Brown.” PEANUTS was born. Soon, readers came to know 
        and love a whole cast of indelible young characters: philosophical Linus and his crabby big 
        sister Lucy; piano-playing Schroeder; attention-grabbing Sally; pals Franklin, Peppermint Patty, 
        Marcie, Pigpen and his famous dust cloud. But no one stole the show quite like Snoopy, 
        the coolest beagle on the planet. From humble beginnings in just seven U.S. newspapers, PEANUTS 
        grew to become not only the best-loved comic strip in history, but a true global phenomenon.
